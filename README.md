# Forest Recorder

Record a forest of trees.

## What is this?

[forestrecorder] is a standalone, dependency-free Python 3.4+ script
that allows you to record a sequence of changes to a `forest` of
`trees`.

A `tree` is a lineage of related `nodes` connected by some
child-to-parent relationship. A `forest` is an unordered collection of
`trees`.

## Why?

When someone asks "What is your favorite movie?", the answer is often
filled with caveats:

- "Are you asking about enjoyment or critical merit?"
- "Do you only include films, or do television series and other video
  streams count?"
- "In what genre?"
- "Does it matter when the movie was shot?"
- "Does it have to be in English?"
- "Are you asking because you want to watch it?"

The notion of a "favorite" requires us to consider the essence of what
it means to prefer one thing over another, and moreover, to consider
what is an eligible thing in the first place.

Instead of comparing a documentary to an animated film for children,
it might make sense that they inhabit different trees in the same
forest, with each node in a tree ordered by preference.

Considering movie preferences as a forest of trees yields answers to
some valuable questions:

- "What is the movie most similar to this one that is better than it?"
- "What movies are dissimilar to anything I've seen?"

It would be incredible to be able to compare forests with strangers
and use them to find new and interesting content.

See [videoforest] for an example using the project.
